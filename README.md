# Gemini GUI

A Gemini client for smartphones and desktops.

## Motivation

This project aims to make the high-performance Gemini API available from smartphones and desktops through a user-friendly interface. Gemini models are known for their speed and efficiency, and this client allows you to harness their power on the go. 
Leveraging the generous free tier offered by many Gemini API providers, this client allows users to explore and experiment with powerful AI capabilities without incurring immediate costs. 

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Android, and Windows.
- **Project Support:** Organize your interactions and related files into projects for better management.
- **Folder Synchronization:** Include entire folders within your projects to provide context and reference materials to the Gemini models.  
- **Intuitive UI:** A clean and modern interface designed for seamless interaction.
- **Markdown Support:** Render formatted text within the chat for enhanced readability.

## Current Limitations

- **Windows UI:** The Windows version currently has incomplete UI support. Some features and visual elements may not be fully implemented.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the specific instructions for your platform in the flutter documentation.

**Building on other Platforms**

While pre-built binaries are currently provided for Android and Windows, the project can be built for other platforms using Flutter's build tools. Refer to the Flutter documentation for platform-specific build instructions.

## Projects

Projects allow you to group related Gemini interactions and relevant files together. Each project can contain multiple folders and files, allowing you to provide rich context and instructions to the Gemini models.

**Project Structure**

- You can add any files or folders to the project.
- Folders and files can be organized within a project to create a structured workspace.
- A `.projectignore` file at the root of a project folder can be used to specify files and folders that should be excluded from synchronization.
